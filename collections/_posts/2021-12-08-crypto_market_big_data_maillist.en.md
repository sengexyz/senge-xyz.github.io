In order to facilitate one's own attention to the cryptocurrency market, Senge wrote a set of exchange big data monitoring program for real-time access to the current currency with the largest and fastest changes. This system can send the crypto status selected by the data mining program to me or multiple users at the same time to help us have a clear picture about the market.

The functions of the current system are: 1) Send the latest and hottest crypto name and the rise of price. 2) Send the crypto that is the most visited. 3) Send the crypto that is the latest trend in the market.
